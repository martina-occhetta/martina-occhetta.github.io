Welcome! I am a first-year PhD student in the <a href='https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/ukri-aidd-doctoral-training-programme/'>AI for Drug Discovery CTP</a> at <a href='https://www.qmul.ac.uk/'>Queen Mary University of London</a>, working in partnership with <a href='https://www.exscientia.com/'>Exscientia</a>. My research, supervised by <a href='https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/staff/conradbessant.html'>Prof. Conrad Bessant</a> and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/mudaliar/?originalSubdomain=uk'>Dr. Mani Mudaliar</a>, explores machine learning methods for biological significance-based drug target identification. 

I graduated from the <a href='https://www.cam.ac.uk/'>University of Cambridge</a> in 2023 with an MPhil in Computational Biology, where I completed my master's thesis under <a href='https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/mv245'>Prof. Michele Vendruscolo</a>. My work focused on AlphaFold2-based prediction of the co-condensation propensity of proteins. Prior to that, I earned a BSc in Biochemistry from <a href='https://www.imperial.ac.uk/'>Imperial College London</a>. I completed my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of <a href='https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/r.weinzierl/about'>Dr. Robert Weinzierl</a>, focusing on molecular dynamic trajectory classification to identify subclasses of structurally similar conformational ensembles.

My interests lie at the intersection between biology, chemistry, and machine learning, with a focus on understanding the behaviour of biological systems at different scales. 

Originally from Milan, Italy, I moved to the UK when I was 18. While I definitely miss the food, the UK has been home long enough that I think I'll stick around â€“ even if the pasta just isn't the same!
