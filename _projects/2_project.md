This project leverages the advanced capabilities of AlphaFold2, a state-of-the-art protein structure prediction tool, to predict the propensity of proteins to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The research focuses on developing computational models to identify single protein phase separation and co-condensation of protein pairs. Utilizing a dataset of experimentally validated proteins, the project aims to enhance our understanding of the biological roles of phase separation and its implications in health and disease. The resulting predictive models promise to significantly aid in identifying proteins involved in biomolecular condensates, offering insights that could inform therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with phase separation. The findings of this research are published at {% cite zhang_alphafold2_2024 %}.
