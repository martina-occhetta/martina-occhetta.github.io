**Enhancing Microscopy Image Resolution through Deconvolution and Structured Illumination**

This project focuses on improving the resolution of microscopy images using advanced deconvolution algorithms. By applying these methods, we aim to overcome the limitations of conventional optical microscopy, particularly the blurring of small and fine specimen structures.

##### Key Objectives:
1. **Understanding Image Formation in Microscopy:**
   - Exploring the image formation process in Fourier space.
   - Analyzing the Point Spread Function (PSF) and Optical Transfer Function (OTF).

2. **Enhanced Resolution with Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM):**
   - Using SIM to exceed the diffraction limit of conventional microscopy.
   - Describing the process in frequency space and leveraging the Moir√© effect to access high-frequency information.

3. **Deconvolution Techniques:**
   - Implementing and comparing different deconvolution algorithms: Landweber, Richardson-Lucy, and Richardson-Lucy Total Variation.
   - Evaluating the performance of these algorithms in improving image resolution and noise suppression.

4. **Practical Application on Biological Data:**
   - Applying these techniques to a dataset of *C. elegans* embryos acquired using a widefield microscope.
   - Using DeconvolutionLab2 in Fiji/ImageJ to perform deconvolution and assess the improvement in image quality.
